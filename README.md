### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mira and I am a student at the University of Southern California (USC). I'm currently studying at London School of Economics and taking the course Data Engineering for the Social World.

I am interested in pursuing product management, data analytics, and operations in the future. I hope to work for a technology company.

I have experience with several programming languages:
- Python
- Java
- C++
- HTML/CSS
- R

  I'm currently working on projects in R and am learning SQL.
